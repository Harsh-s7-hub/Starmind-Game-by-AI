# 🌿 GRASS TEXTURE SETUP - IMPORTANT!

## The grass texture file currently exists but is just a placeholder (0.1 KB).

### To complete the setup:

1. **Right-click on the grass image** you sent in the chat
2. **Save it to this exact location:**
   ```
   C:\Users\Dhanush\OneDrive\Desktop\airport_management\Starmind-Game-by-AI\AI\iaatcms_3d\assets\grass_texture.jpg
   ```
3. **Overwrite** the existing placeholder file

### Alternative: Use Python to save it

If you have the image saved elsewhere (e.g., Downloads folder):

```bash
python setup_grass.py "C:\Users\Dhanush\Downloads\grass_image.jpg"
```

### Verify it worked:

```bash
python check_visual_setup.py
```

The grass texture file should now be > 10 KB (not 0.1 KB).

### Then run the simulation:

```bash
python main.py
```

## What you'll see:

✅ **Beautiful grass texture background** - realistic grass covering the entire simulation area  
✅ **Professional taxiways** - dark asphalt with yellow dashed centerlines (like real airports!)  
✅ **Enhanced gates** - with shadows and blue borders  
✅ **Better visibility** - bright yellow taxi node markers  

The difference will be dramatic compared to the old plain blue background!
